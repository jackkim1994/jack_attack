            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Origin</b><br>
              <img src="HK.jpg" alt="Hong Kong" width="100" height="100"><br>
              I was born and raised in Hong Kong, a renowned tourist spot and financial hub in East Asia.<br>
              I was fortunate to visit different cities and explore cultures at an early age, developing my ability to accept different perspectives and adjust accordingly.<br>
              Even though I am Korean, my international background has often led me to call myself a global nomad.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Military Service</b><br>
              <img src="military.jpg" alt="Northwestern University" width="100" height="100">
              In the middle of my undergraduate year at UCLA, I joined the two-year military service at the Republic of Korea Air Force.<br>
              It was an intriguing experience that gave me an insight into how the "company" operated, although it was stricter and operated at a smaller scale.<br>
              I learned the importance of responsibility, discipline, and proactiveness, which became my foundation when I returned to the United States.<br>
              <br>
              <b>What am I doing now?</b><br>
              <img src="NU.jpg" alt="Northwestern University" width="100" height="100"><br>
              I am currently studying Machine Learning and Data Science as a graduate student at Northwestern University.<br>
              Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/">GOBankingRates</a> for around four years.<br>
              In this company, I encountered a banking client that implemented an imperfect fraud detection algorithm that hurt marketing performances across partner affiliates, including us.<br>
              After experiencing this incident, I became more interested in data science and desired to contribute.<br>
              While I am still determining where I will end up in my full-time career after completing the graduate program, I am willing to continue honing my skills in the ever-growing data science field.

              <b>Predicting Loan Mortgage Loan Defaulters</b><br>
              <a href="https://github.com/jackkim1994/MIT_Applied_Data_Science_Capstone">Reference to Github</a><br>
              This was my first capstone project with the MIT Professional Education certificate program.<br>
              After testing with different methodologies, such as Random Forest and Decision Tree, I utilized the tuned classification Random Forest model to find the optimal combination that predicts Mortgage loan defaults with the highest Recall Rate and Accuracy.

              <b>Moraleâ€™s Effect on Fatigue and Injury</b><br>
              <a href="http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/past-datafests/2019-asa-datafesttm-results/">Finalist at ASA UCLA DataFest 2019</a><br>
              This project was the Case Competition sponsored by ASA UCLA, and I participated with my teammates.<br>
              Due to NDA, we were not allowed to disclose the code and data from the competition, so I could not provide a link in Github.<br>
              To summarize, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to choose features that contributed to fatigue based on the player survey, and we discovered that some players were willing to understate their fatigue when they won important, difficult games.<br>
              This led us to recommend judges that strength and conditioning coaches must be extra meticulous when analyzing player conditions after these games, for they can lead to a higher chance of injury.
